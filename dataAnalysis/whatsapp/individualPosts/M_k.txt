3/10/17, 12:32 PM - Muhammad Khan: I hate to break it to you but we're all human beings, and going to the moon isn't important contrary to what you may think but saving lives is, thats why you get taught biology and not astronomy in middle school.

3/23/17, 9:01 PM - Muhammad Khan: Sorry😂
3/23/17, 11:27 PM - Muhammad Khan: Chutiyan hain bhangi insan
3/25/17, 8:41 PM - Muhammad Khan: The answer is B
3/25/17, 8:43 PM - Muhammad Khan: I'm not sure if there is a quicker way to do it, but I simply assumed a random value for a and 2 random values for y, found x and made a graph
3/25/17, 8:43 PM - Muhammad Khan: Make sure to use y=0 though
3/25/17, 8:45 PM - Muhammad Khan: Yup
3/25/17, 8:45 PM - Muhammad Khan: You don't even need to put values actually
3/25/17, 8:45 PM - Muhammad Khan: The answer is right there
3/25/17, 8:46 PM - Muhammad Khan: Gradient is negative and so is the year intercept so look for the graph that matches
3/25/17, 8:46 PM - Muhammad Khan: Y* intercept
3/25/17, 8:47 PM - Muhammad Khan: 1/4
3/25/17, 8:48 PM - Muhammad Khan: Das how we roll😎
3/25/17, 8:49 PM - Muhammad Khan: Find either the gradient or y intercept of each of the lines
3/25/17, 8:49 PM - Muhammad Khan: Y intercept of b=-3
3/25/17, 8:49 PM - Muhammad Khan: A=-12
3/25/17, 8:50 PM - Muhammad Khan: 3/12 equals 1/4
3/25/17, 8:50 PM - Muhammad Khan: Negatives cancel out
3/25/17, 8:52 PM - Muhammad Khan: Agai samajh?
3/25/17, 8:54 PM - Muhammad Khan: Mene farsi mein likha kia😂
3/25/17, 8:54 PM - Muhammad Khan: Anyway nice job
3/25/17, 9:12 PM - Muhammad Khan: Because be is a a product of a and both intercept as well as gradient can be used to find the magnitude of the enlargement.
3/25/17, 9:14 PM - Muhammad Khan: Think about it like this...
3/25/17, 9:16 PM - Muhammad Khan: What should we multiply a with to turn it into b?
3/25/17, 9:16 PM - Muhammad Khan: Since a is 12
3/25/17, 9:16 PM - Muhammad Khan: And be is 3
3/25/17, 9:16 PM - Muhammad Khan: Multiply by 1/4
3/25/17, 9:17 PM - Muhammad Khan: Yes
3/25/17, 9:48 PM - Muhammad Khan: Wth😂😂
3/25/17, 9:48 PM - Muhammad Khan: Pussy

3/28/17, 12:28 AM - Muhammad Khan: Pura question bhejo
3/28/17, 10:34 AM - Muhammad Khan: Having no solution means they don't intercept.
3/28/17, 10:34 AM - Muhammad Khan: Make some quick drawings and tadda
3/28/17, 10:35 AM - Muhammad Khan: I'm not sure if there is a quicker way though
3/28/17, 10:39 AM - Muhammad Khan: Egjactly
3/28/17, 10:40 AM - Muhammad Khan: You only have to draw for c and d
3/28/17, 10:40 AM - Muhammad Khan: Because if the gradients are different there will always be a solution
3/28/17, 11:06 AM - Muhammad Khan: There must be some parallel lines
3/28/17, 11:06 AM - Muhammad Khan: Otherwise it's literally impossible
3/28/17, 11:07 AM - Muhammad Khan: Then it's impossible
3/28/17, 11:07 AM - Muhammad Khan: Check the question again
3/28/17, 11:50 AM - Muhammad Khan: Oh you were supposed to add
3/28/17, 11:50 AM - Muhammad Khan: I thought y I used were supposed to find each angle individually
3/28/17, 11:51 AM - Muhammad Khan: Easy as hell
3/28/17, 11:51 AM - Muhammad Khan: Three triangles so 180×3=540
3/28/17, 11:52 AM - Muhammad Khan: Subtract 180(straight line) so 360
3/28/17, 11:55 AM - Muhammad Khan: Was that sarcasm?
3/28/17, 11:55 AM - Muhammad Khan: 😒
3/28/17, 11:55 AM - Muhammad Khan: Abhi nai yaar

3/28/17, 4:01 PM - Muhammad Khan: Right?
3/28/17, 4:15 PM - Muhammad Khan: Dusra karlia?
3/28/17, 4:55 PM - Muhammad Khan: B
3/28/17, 4:56 PM - Muhammad Khan: You're not supposed to add 32
3/28/17, 6:29 PM - Muhammad Khan: It is indeed D
3/29/17, 11:36 AM - Muhammad Khan: Angle C is 109.47
3/29/17, 11:36 AM - Muhammad Khan: B is 70.53
3/29/17, 11:37 AM - Muhammad Khan: Aage karlo gai ke bataun?

3/30/17, 2:14 PM - Muhammad Khan: I think it'll be (34+42/19+30+34+42)×100
3/30/17, 2:15 PM - Muhammad Khan: For probability you don't multiply by 100 though
3/30/17, 2:16 PM - Muhammad Khan: Answer bata do agar sai hai ke nai
3/31/17, 12:23 AM - Muhammad Khan: Shadab❤❤❤
3/31/17, 10:55 AM - Muhammad Khan: Q7 is B I reckon

3/31/17, 10:59 AM - Muhammad Khan: Q17 is A
3/31/17, 11:01 AM - Muhammad Khan: The first one is D
3/31/17, 7:57 PM - Muhammad Khan: I got the same answer as sadeed
3/31/17, 7:57 PM - Muhammad Khan: So I guess yeah, it is.
4/1/17, 1:05 PM - Muhammad Khan: So you didn't hate them when they destroyed Vietnam, Iraq and Syria and Libya.
