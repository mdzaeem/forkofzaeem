PakTurk A/level has Two sections in Both A1 and A2.
A1 and A2 have further Two subsections 'A' and 'B'.
PakTurk has some teachers to teach both Sections and subsections.
A timetable is required to allocate timing efficiently with some rules.

Facts:
1): Sunday is off.
2): at least 3 lectures per week.
3): not more than 2 lectures per day.
4): scattered lectures are always preferred.
5): time for one lecture is 1:20

#===== Necessary Input Information ===========
1): time range for which a particular teacher is available
2): School timinging range
3): Subjects ordered preference wise

#===== Algorithm ============
step 1): input file will contain parameters e.g +++++++
>>> Teachers_list = [name1,name2, ...] 
>>> Teachers_timing=[[start_time,end_time],[start_time,end_time], ...)]
>>> school_timing = [start_time,end_time]
>>> time_lenght = [minutes]
>>> Lectures_per_week = [number_of_lectures]

step 2): python will generate prolog knowledge base, then prolog intepreter will access this file. ++++++++

step 3): A user will make some querries and appropriate output will be generated.
